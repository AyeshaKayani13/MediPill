MediPill - This is a healthcare app that I built for my Individual Project at City, University of London.
The project has achieved a mark of 72%.

### Abstract
My proposed iOS healthcare app is a prototype designed to improve the quality of care provided to care home residents. It facilitates medication management, appointment scheduling, and patient record keeping.

The app will allow staff to easily schedule and send medication and appointment reminders to residents, ensuring that medications are taken on time and appointments are not missed. In addition, the app enables staff members to conveniently access and modify patient records, providing a comprehensive overview of each resident's medical history and current health status.

As a university student, I aim to utilize my proficiency in iOS development and user-centric design to develop an app that is user-friendly and customized for the requirements of care home residents and staff. In the end, the app would serve to enhance the standard of care given to residents of care homes and facilitate and enhance the job of care home employees.


## Introduction
Initially, I intended to create a pill reminder app as this was something I could relate to. Living with elderly members I would see how much medication they must regularly take, but often forget to or couldn’t remember if they already took their pills that day or not.
After doing some research online and from the knowledge I gained from my internship, I was made aware of the insufficient use of technology within care homes. Having previously worked on a project for a well-known UK Healthcare Provider, my main role was to help with the integrations between their Hospitals and Care Homes. Although the company is a global competitor, you’d assume that they would have these basic integrations already in place.
The problem I am aiming to address is the insufficient use of technology within care homes, resulting in difficulty in managing patient medication reminders, appointment schedules, and medical records. The solution I am proposing is a single app for Care Home workers incorporating these features to streamline and improve their business operations.

### 1.2 Objectives
Having primary and secondary objectives helps to clarify the project's purpose and priorities.
• Primary objectives - Main goals
• Secondary objectives – The supporting goals that help to achieve the primary
objective.

#### 1.2.1 Primary Objectives
1. Develop an easy-to-use iOS healthcare app that incorporates pill reminders, patient appointment reminders, and patient records for care home residents used by staff.
2. Streamline the medication management process for care home staff, reducing the risk of medication errors and improving patient outcomes.
3. Enhance patient care by improving appointment scheduling to reduce missed appointments.
4. Allow care-home staff, to access patient records in real-time to make informed decisions.

#### 1.2.2 Secondary Objectives
1. Allow for easy data entry and record keeping.
2. Provide customizable reminders and notifications to ensure that residents take their
medication on time and attend appointments.

### 1.3 Project Beneficiaries
My prototype has no current beneficiaries, however, if it were deployed in a real-life setting, the solution's proposed beneficiaries would care home residents and care home staff.
To assist the residents in maintaining their health and well-being, the app would remind the care home staff about any upcoming medications or appointments for their patients. Also, it would reduce medication errors and enhance efficiency among Care Home staff in managing medication schedules, appointments, and patient records.

### 1.4 Project Limitations
As a prototype developed by a university student without any real beneficiaries, there are some limitations to the proposed project.
Some potential limitations include:
1. Limited Resources: As a student, there may be limited resources, including time,
funding, and access to healthcare professionals along with the technology resources I may need to further develop my app. This may impact the overall quality of my app.
2. Limited Feedback: Without real beneficiaries, it may be challenging to gather comprehensive feedback from the target users, which could limit the app's ability to meet the unique needs and requirements of care home staff and residents.
3. Limited Real-World Testing: Without real-world testing with actual beneficiaries, it may be challenging to determine the app's effectiveness and identify any areas that require improvement.

### 1.5 Risks
#### 1.5.1 RiskstomyProject
Below is a list of potential risks relating specifically to my project:
1. User acceptance: From my research earlier, I gathered that there may be resistance from care home staff to adopt new technology, affecting the success of the app. To mitigate this, I will regularly gather feedback from those around me to understand their experiences with the application and identify areas for improvement.
2. Data privacy and security: The app will be handling sensitive patient information, and it's important to ensure the protection of this data. To mitigate this, I will be using a dummy dataset with fake patient details.
3. Integration with existing systems: The app may need to integrate with existing systems used in care homes, leading to potential compatibility issues. Since this is a student project, I will only be building a prototype so this isn’t an issue, I will face. However, if this application was to be deployed for a customer to mitigate this risk, I would conduct a compatibility test of the new application with existing systems before deployment to identify and address any potential issues.

#### 1.5.2 Risks that my project poses to others.
Below is a list of potential risks for my project that may harm others and how to reduce them to acceptable levels:
• Data privacy and security: The app will handle sensitive patient information and it's important to ensure that this data is protected from unauthorized access or misuse. I will be using a dummy dataset, however, if I were to deploy this project in a real-life setting, I would be using real patient records. To reduce any risks associated with this I will put in place appropriate security measures such as encryption, secure data storage, and access controls would be implemented and regularly tested.
• User error: Care home staff may use the app incorrectly, leading to incorrect or inconsistent patient information. This solution is only a prototype, so I will not face this risk; however, to reduce the risk of user error in a real-life setting, I will suggest my client provide comprehensive user training and support for the care home staff. Additionally, a user-friendly interface should be implemented in the app to help reduce this risk.
