## Abstract
My proposed iOS healthcare app is a prototype designed to improve the quality of care provided to care home residents. It facilitates medication management, appointment scheduling, and patient record keeping.

The app will allow staff to easily schedule and send medication and appointment reminders to residents, ensuring that medications are taken on time and appointments are not missed. In addition, the app enables staff members to conveniently access and modify patient records, providing a comprehensive overview of each resident's medical history and current health status.

As a university student, I aim to utilize my proficiency in iOS development and user-centric design to develop an app that is user-friendly and customized for the requirements of care home residents and staff. In the end, the app would serve to enhance the standard of care given to residents of care homes and facilitate and enhance the job of care home employees.
